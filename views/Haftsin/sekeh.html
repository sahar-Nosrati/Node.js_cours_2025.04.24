      <p>
        As part of the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) celebration, the Haft-Seen
        table is a cherished and meaningful tradition that honors the arrival
        of spring and the rebirth of nature. “Haft-Seen” means “Seven S’s,”
        referring to seven symbolic items that all begin with the Persian
        letter س (Seen). Each item on the table carries a hopeful wish for the
        new year. Common elements include:
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/sabzeh">Sabzeh </a> (sprouted
        greens) for rebirth and growth
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Senjed">Senjed </a>(dried oleaster
        fruit) for love,
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Sir">Seer(garlic)</a> for health,
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Sib">Sib (apple)</a> for beauty
        and vitality,
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Samanou"> Samanu </a> (sweet wheat
        pudding) for strength and power,
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Serkeh"> Serkeh </a> (vinegar) for
        patience and wisdom,
        <a class="hyperlink" href="/haftsin/Sekeh"> Sekkeh </a> (coins) for
        wealth and prosperity The Haft-Seen is often accompanied by other
        meaningful items, such as a mirror, candles, painted eggs, poetry
        books, a goldfish, and sometimes a holy book—each adding layers of
        symbolism, spirituality, and joy. Together, these elements create more
        than just a festive display. The Haft-Seen table reflects the values
        of hope, renewal, light, and balance—a beautiful echo of the spring
        equinox and the spirit of new beginnings.
