Nowruz, meaning "new day" in Persian, is the celebration of the Iranian New Year, observed on the spring equinox—around March 20–21. Rooted in over 3,000 years of tradition, Nowruz marks not just the start of a new calendar year, but also the rebirth of nature, a time when light and life return after winter’s rest.

A Celebration of Nature and New Beginnings

Coinciding with the vernal equinox, when day and night are nearly equal, Nowruz reflects the harmony and balance found in nature. It is a time of hope, renewal, and reflection, observed by millions of people in Iran, Central Asia, the Middle East, and beyond.

Traditions and Symbols

One of the most beloved customs of Nowruz is the preparation of the Haft-Seen table. This beautifully arranged table features seven symbolic items starting with the Persian letter "S" (seen), each representing a concept such as rebirth, health, love, patience, and prosperity. Families also engage in house cleaning (khaneh tekani), wear new clothes, visit loved ones, and share festive meals.

Cultural and Spiritual Significance

Nowruz is more than a holiday—it’s a deeply spiritual and cultural observance that emphasizes inner renewal, gratitude, and human connection. Recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, it has transcended time and borders, uniting people through its message of peace and rebirth.

As the earth tilts towards the Sun and light returns, Nowruz reminds us to embrace change, celebrate life, and welcome each new beginning with open hearts. It’s not just the start of spring—it’s a celebration of life itself.
